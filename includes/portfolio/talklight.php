      <p>Talk Light is an experiment developed to practice and display some techniques learned during my work experience.  This is a project that is meant to display and analyze information on a room's lighting.  The data is acquired by a python script and then pushed to a database.  A webapp then displays the data in graphical form which can then be analyzed.
