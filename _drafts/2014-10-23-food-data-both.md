I love food. When I was a kid (and sometimes even today), all I wanted to do was cook. Food brings people together - whether it is a way to catch up with friends, come together as a family or to celebrate a special occasion. Food captures the culture of its cuisine and acts as a tool to share it with others. Food can be used as a way of expressing new ideas. That is why I love food! It\'s versatile as a form of art, as comfort and as a tool. 

However, I did not steer my career into the culinary arts (for now). Instead, I decided to pursue engineering. My major, System Design Engineering at the Univeristy of Waterloo, has taught me to see problems holistically, rigorously analyze data and to design elegant solutions that meet the needs of the user. This is where I realized the potential engineering has to impact so many people. The ability to build systems that can save a life inspires me to become better at what I do. 

To practice on these two passions, I decided to start writing my ideas, adventures and opinions. I intend to share my thoughts on topics such as recipes to data dives. I hope my little blog keeps you entertained and inspires you to do what you love too!
